# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python.

## Game Description

This game allows two players, X and O, to take turns marking a square on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a tie.

## Features

* Simple and intuitive gameplay
* Input validation to prevent invalid moves
* Automatic detection of winner or tie

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git`
2. Navigate to the repository: `cd tic-tac-toe`
3. Run the game: `python main.py`

## Gameplay

1. The game will display the current state of the board.
2. The current player will be prompted to enter their move (1-9).
3. The game will update the board and check for a winner or tie.
4. Players will alternate turns until the game is won or tied.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into three main functions:

* `print_board(board)`: prints the current state of the board
* `check_winner(board)`: checks if there's a winner or tie
* `main()`: the main game loop
